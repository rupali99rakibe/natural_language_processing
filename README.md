NLP Pipeline with NLTK and SpaCy
Welcome to the NLP Pipeline repository! This repository serves as a comprehensive resource for building NLP pipelines using the NLTK and SpaCy libraries in Python.

Overview
This repository covers the implementation of NLP pipelines for various text processing tasks, including tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition, and more.

Contents
1. NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
Introduction to NLTK: installation, corpus, and basic text processing functionalities.
Tokenization: word tokenization, sentence tokenization, and custom tokenization.
Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging: tagging parts of speech in text data.
Named Entity Recognition (NER): extracting named entities from text.
2. SpaCy
Introduction to SpaCy: installation, language models, and basic usage.
Tokenization and POS tagging with SpaCy.
Dependency parsing: analyzing syntactic dependencies between words.
Named Entity Recognition (NER) with SpaCy.
3. Pipeline Integration
Building NLP pipelines combining NLTK and SpaCy functionalities.
Preprocessing text data: cleaning, tokenization, and normalization.
Performing advanced NLP tasks sequentially using both libraries.
4. Case Studies
Practical examples and case studies demonstrating the implementation of NLP pipelines for real-world tasks.
Datasets and analysis techniques to reinforce learning.
